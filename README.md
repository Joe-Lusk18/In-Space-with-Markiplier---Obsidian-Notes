Hey everyone!
In recent months, I discovered Obsidian.md and started using it for notes and small projects. About two weeks ago I had the thought: “What if I made a choose-your-own adventure with this?”
That quickly turned into: “What if I turn a multi-hour experience (6+ hours of content) into a fully written, interactive format?”
So… I said screw it. I’m doing it.
I’ve uploaded the files for everything I’ve completed so far. There’s a full Welcome Card inside the vault, but here’s a quick summary of what to expect:
### **Welcome Card Summary**
- This is a fan-made written adaptation of In Space with Markiplier.
- The project is designed specifically for Obsidian, where you navigate the story using internal links as your choices.
   **Early release / unfinished:**
  - The opening sequence and first decision path are fully written.
  - Part 1 structure, choices, and endings are connected.
  - Most other sections currently contain placeholders and navigation only.
- **The goal of this release is to:**
   1. Test navigation and readability
   2. See if people enjoy the concept
   3. Gather feedback before continuing full transcription
- **Spoiler warning:** Recommended only if you’ve already played the original.
- Dialogue and scenes are adapted for text, with minimal stage directions and small adjustments where needed.
- Character pages, alternate path naming, and links to original videos are included where applicable.

**How to use the files**
1. Download Obsidian (recommended, but not required).
2. Download the zipped folder and extract it.
3. Open Obsidian → Open folder as vault → select the extracted folder.
4. Open the Welcome Card and start from there.

(You CAN view the files in another text editor like Notepad++, but the experience will be limited and a lot more confusing. For the best experience, download Obsidian (it's free, what is there to lose?))

If you have questions, feedback, or find broken links/formatting issues, feel free to comment or DM me.

**Important:** This is **NOWHERE NEAR DONE**.
Right now only the intro and first set of choices are fully written, and those alone took a long time. I’m posting this to see if people enjoy the idea and if there’s interest in a fully completed version.
Thanks for checking it out!
